Powered by [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), cookiecutter-doge provides a template to generate Doge :dog2: projects. Doge (Digital Ocean, Github, tErraform) is a GitOps workflow to ensure multi-environment continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) for docker-compose applications to Digital Ocean using Github and Terraform. It has been mainly developed to deploy Django applications based on the [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django) framework, but it can be extended to other docker-compose setups that require remote infrastructure.

See the [documentation](https://cookiecutter-doge.readthedocs.io), [example project](https://github.com/martibosch/doge-hello-world) with a "Hello, World!" app (using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)) and [its corresponding user guide](https://github.com/martibosch/doge-hello-world/blob/main/README.md).
